## Introduction
>The *differential* and *equation* suggest solving some kind of equation that contains derivatives $y'$, $y''$
> Solving differential equations such as $y'' + 2y' + y = 0$ for unknown fuction $y = \phi\left(x\right)$.

### Introduction to Differential Equations

#### Definition 1.1.1
Differential Equation
>An equation containing the derivatives for one or more unknown fucntions (or dependent variable), with respect to one or more independent variables, is said to be a **differential equation (DE)**


#### Classification by Type
If a differential equation contains only ordinary derivatives of one or more unknown fucntions with resprect to a single independent variable, it is said to be an **ordinary differential equation (ODE)**.
> Example 1.1.1
> 
> $$\frac{dy}{dx} + y = e^{x}$$


If an equation involving partial derivatives of one or more unknown functions of two or more independent variables is a **partial differential equation (PDE)**.
> Example 1.1.2
> 
> $$\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} + y = 0$$

#### Classification by Order
The order of a differential eqaution is the order of the highest derivative in the equation.

$$\frac{dy}{dx} + y = e^{x}$$

The order of above equation is one.

#### Differential Form

$$M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0$$
