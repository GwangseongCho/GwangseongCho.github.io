## What is ontology?
> As a first approximation, ontology is the study of what there is. 
> Some contest this formulation of what ontology is, so it’s only a first approximation. Many classical philosophical problems are problems in ontology: the question whether or not there is a god, or the problem of the existence of universals, etc.. 
> These are all problems in ontology in the sense that they deal with whether or not a certain thing, or more broadly entity, exists.
