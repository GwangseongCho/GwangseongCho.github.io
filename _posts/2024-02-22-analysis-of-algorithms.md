## 1 Theory Questions
**Q 1.1 Explain the process of backward substitution in solving recurrence relations. ?**
* The backword substitution -> We put the n = n, n-1, n-2,... or n = n,n/2,n/4,... until we see the pattern.
* Process of backword substitution
1.  Rewrite the relation in term of x 
2.  Using T(x) workout a new expression for T(x)  




  
**Q 1.2 How does it differ from other methods like the iterative method**


**Q2. Discuss the master theorem. What are its limitations and in what types of recurrence relations is it most useful?**

**Q3. Compare and contrast backward substitution and the master theorem. In what scenarios would you prefer one method over the other?**
