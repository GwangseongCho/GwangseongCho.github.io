## Abstract Data Type
ADT is an abstraction of data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.
The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in which programming language.
* List  - Dynamic Array, Linked List
* Queue - Linked list based Queue, Array based Queue, Stack based Queue
* Map - Tree Map, Hash Map, Hash Table

## Computational Complexity Analysis
Time and Space 
Big O notation give an upper bound of the complexity in the worst case.
