## Introduction
>The *differential* and *equation* suggest solving some kind of equation that contains derivatives $y'$, $y''$
> Solving differential equations such as $y'' + 2y' + y = 0$ for unknown fuction $y = \phi\left(x\right)$.

## Chapter 1
### Introduction to Differential Equations
#### Definition 1.1.1
Differntial Equation
>An equation containing the derivatives for one or more unknown fucntions (or dependent variable), with respect to one or more independent variables, is said to be a **differential equation (DE)**
