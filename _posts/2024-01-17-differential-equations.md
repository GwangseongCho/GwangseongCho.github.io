## Introduction
>The *differential* and *equation* suggest solving some kind of equation that contains derivatives \(y'\), \(y''\).
> Solving differential equations such as \(y'' + 2y' + y = 0\) for an unknown function \(y = \phi(x)\).

## Chapter 1

### Introduction to Differential Equations

#### Definition 1.1.1
**Differential Equation**
>An equation containing the derivatives for one or more unknown functions (or dependent variable), concerning one or more independent variables, is said to be a *differential equation (DE)*.

#### Classification by Type
Suppose a differential equation contains only ordinary derivatives of one or more unknown functions concerning a single independent variable. In that case, it is considered an *ordinary differential equation (ODE)*.
> Example 1.1.1:
> \(\frac{dy}{dx} + y = e^{x}\)

If an equation involving partial derivatives of one or more unknown functions of two or more independent variables is a *partial differential equation (PDE)*.
> Example 1.1.2:
> \(\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} + y = 0\)

#### Classification by Order
A differential equation is the order of the highest derivative in the equation.
\(\frac{dy}{dx} + y = e^{x}\)

**Differential Form**
\(M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0\)
